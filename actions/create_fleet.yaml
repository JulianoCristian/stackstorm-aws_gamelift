  EC2InstanceType:
    type: string
    description: "Name of an EC2 instance type that is supported in Amazon GameLift.

  Description:
    type: string
    description: "Human-readable description of a fleet."
  ServerLaunchPath:
    type: string
    description: "This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify a server launch path using the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. (Requests that specify a server launch path and launch parameters instead of a run-time configuration will continue to work.)"
  ServerLaunchParameters:

  LogPaths:
    type: array
    description: "This parameter is no longer used. Instead, to specify where Amazon GameLift should store log files once a server process shuts down, use the Amazon GameLift server API ProcessReady() and specify one or more directory paths in logParameters. See more information in the Server API Reference. "
  EC2InboundPermissions:
    type: array
    description: "Range of IP addresses and port settings that permit inbound traffic to access server processes running on the fleet.

    description: "Game session protection policy to apply to all instances in this fleet. If this parameter is not set, instances in this fleet default to no protection. You can change a fleet's protection policy using UpdateFleetAttributes, but this change will only affect sessions created after the policy change. You can also set protection for individual instances using UpdateGameSession.    NoProtection -- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down event.    FullProtection -- If the game session is in an ACTIVE status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.  "
  RuntimeConfiguration:
    type: object
    description: "Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the fleet. The run-time configuration for a fleet has a collection of server process configurations, one for each type of server process to run on an instance. A server process configuration specifies the location of the server executable, launch parameters, and the number of concurrent processes with that configuration to maintain on each instance. A CreateFleet request must include a run-time configuration with at least one server process configuration; otherwise the request fails with an invalid request exception. (This parameter replaces the parameters ServerLaunchPath and ServerLaunchParameters; requests that contain values for these parameters instead of a run-time configuration will continue to work.) "
